You are an expert front-end and SEO web developer.
You are working on the Fresh Plus Cleaning Services Melbourne homepage built in Next.js with TailwindCSS.
Your task is to fix the homepage content, structure, and SEO step by step using a clear “Plan → Implement → Review” workflow.
Keep existing sections and order. Do not remove service items or change brand identity.

STEP 1 – PLAN

Goal: Analyze current homepage layout and text.
Action:

Identify all repeated CTAs or redundant text (e.g., multiple “Book Now”, “Get Quote”).

Note any missing visuals (hero, icons, testimonial images).

List what needs to be improved in each section based on the audit below.

Output a numbered plan showing exactly what code sections will change.

Reference Audit Summary:

Header & Hero: repeated CTAs, missing visual balance.

Navigation: duplicate lines and non-sticky nav.

Stats: inconsistent layout.

Services: emojis, crowded text.

Why Choose Us: verbose and repetitive.

Testimonials: too long, not formatted.

CTA block: disorganized.

Footer: duplicate tagline.

SEO: missing suburbs, meta title, and description.

STEP 2 – IMPLEMENT

Goal: Rewrite and refactor code section by section.
Follow this exact order and apply these directives:

Header & Hero

Keep logo + tagline.

Replace all CTAs with one “Get Free Quote” button.

Add hero background image (professional cleaner or clean home).

Use Tailwind classes for spacing and text contrast.

Navigation

Order links: Home, Services, About, Blog, Contact.

Remove duplicate text blocks.

Make sticky top navigation.

Stats Bar

Align horizontally with icons.

Display: 12+ Years, 5000+ Clients, 100% Satisfaction, 24/7 Support.

Services Section

Replace emojis with clean SVG icons.

Each card: icon, short heading, one-line description.

Maintain grid layout, add equal padding.

Why Choose Us

Rewrite text to 1–2 lines per point.

Headings: Local Team, Eco-Friendly Products, Flexible Scheduling, Satisfaction Guarantee.

Testimonials

Use cards or slider (shadcn/ui or Swiper).

Limit each to one-line highlight + name/suburb.

Add 4.9★ badge.

CTA Section

Add single headline: “Ready for a Cleaner Home or Office?”

One button: “Get Free Quote”.

List contact info (call, text, email, quote) in two neat columns.

Footer

Remove duplicate tagline.

Keep Services, About, Blog, Contact, Privacy, Terms.

Make phone and email clickable.

SEO and Meta

Add <Head> tags:

Title: Fresh Plus Cleaning Melbourne | Residential & Commercial Cleaners

Meta description: Professional cleaning services for homes and offices across Melbourne. Fully insured, eco-friendly, and trusted by 5000+ clients.

Add alt text for all images.

Include suburb keywords in text: Melbourne CBD, Toorak, Richmond, South Yarra, Hawthorn.

Short paragraphs (<60 words each).

STEP 3 – REVIEW

Goal: Check for professional polish and UX balance.
Checklist:

No repeated CTAs.

Consistent padding and alignment.

Font hierarchy consistent (H1, H2, H3).

Images and icons responsive.

Text tone human and natural, not AI-generic.

Suburb keywords appear naturally 3–5 times.

No section visually overloaded.

If any fail, iterate automatically and refine until polished.

FINAL OUTPUT

Return the revised Next.js + Tailwind JSX file for pages/index.tsx or app/page.tsx.
Keep it production-ready and formatted with Prettier style.
Do not output placeholder text. Replace everything directly with the improved copy and layout.
